## About Me

My goal in learning about and working with LLMs is to create tools that facilitate easier, more affordable, faster, and more accurate access to knowledge. By empowering individuals with tools to navigate through the complexities of information, especially in areas where it is traditionally expensive or convoluted, I aim to make information clear, accessible, and understandable for all.

Using OpenAI's Whisper API, LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, and Ollama Embeddings, this notebook converts audio to text, tokenizes it, and generates embeddings. Now you can ask questions directly of your audio files.
